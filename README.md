# ElevateLabs_EDA_Task2
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Task 2 is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) assignment. The objective is to understand a dataset using statistics and visualizations. You are free to use any relevant dataset, such as the Titanic Dataset.

The task involves several key steps:
Generating summary statistics (mean, median, etc.).
Creating histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
Using pairplots or a correlation matrix to explore relationships between features.
Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
Making basic inferences from the visuals.
The recommended tools are Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
